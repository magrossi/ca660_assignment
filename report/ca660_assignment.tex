\begin{abstract}
Widely attributed as the cause of the global market crisis of 2007, the house pricing bubble is an important topic of research. Economists try to explain the causes of this bubble and ways of preventing it in the future.

Studies previous to the house crash were inconclusive and researches did not agree that the housing market was in a bubble (\citep{unknown2010} and \citep{winter2003}).
